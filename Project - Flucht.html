          <p><a href="https://www.aerzte-ohne-grenzen.de/flucht-weltweit" target="_blank"> Menschen auf der Flucht weltweit</a> (shortly <i>Flucht</i>) is a website with which <i>Ärzte ohne Grenzen</i> try to raise awareness about the various issues related to refugees. The website consists of the main page and various subpages that tell stories about the refugees in different countries. The basic structure is something called “scrollytelling”. That means that the user follows a story by scrolling down the site. Originally the website was a substitute for a booklet, and so it is quite particular by its nature.</p>
          <p>Even though the website is beautiful and the users seem to appreciate the content, the analytics show that they have clearly had difficulties in finding their way from one content to another. This was where I came in. My job was to detect the problems and bottlenecks and to find ways to improve the site. </p>
          <p>Due to respect for my client, I will hold on to a certain level of abstraction and try to avoid going into too much detail.  </p>

    <h4>My Approach</h4>

    <section class="flucht_section">
      <div class="container">
        <div>
          <p>I took time to analyse the site profoundly. I used my desktop and various mobile phone models and tried to discover the problems mentioned in the briefing. Soon I noticed that they were rather apparent. I decided that any usability testing wasn’t needed at this point. In my report, I mentioned <strong>five problems</strong> that all are tightly related to one another:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The main problem of the site is that its structure and content are not clear enough. Even the whole idea of the site doesn’t come out that easy.</li><br>
            <li>The core of the problem is that the subpages are too well hidden. There are not enough clues of their existence and the navigation system on the main page is not very intuitive.</li><br>
            <li>The problem is even worse on the subpages. When landing on one of them first, it is really difficult to get a hold of the whole and the options to proceed.</li><br>
            <li>The escape routes out of the site are too striking and seductive in comparison to the links leading to other content within the site.</li><br>
            <li>According to the briefing, the majority of the visitors use mobile devices. I noticed some grave functional problems on some mobile versions. However, my main question is still whether the navigation system can ever suit any mobile device satisfyingly.</li>
          </ol>

    <h4>Improvements</h4>

    <section class="flucht_section">
      <div class="container">
        <div>
          <p>So, my goal was to help the users to grasp the essence of the site. I wanted them to know what is going on at every moment of their visit. To be able to see where they are on the site and which are the possibilities available to them. </p>
          <p>I drew sketches for both desktop and mobile versions. They would help the developers to make the necessary changes. As it is in big organisations, it is not always so easy to get all the changes approved. That is why I made suggestions of different levels starting from improved titles and ending with a totally new navigation system. At this moment, it is still unknown, which changes will be approved by the department ultimately responsible for the site. </p>
          <p>Like with the problems, I named <strong>five crucial improvements</strong>. Here they are listed according to their urgency, so the two lists are not in sync.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>In my view, changing the route from one subpage to another is the most urgent and also the easiest improvement (see problem 3). I wanted to cut out the middleman and provide direct links between the subpages.</li><br>
            <li>Next, I wanted to improve the main navigation system (see problem 2). I offered two alternatives: either to change the whole system at least for the mobile version, or just to revamp the titles and strengthen the guidance.</li><br>
            <li>In order to fight the main problem 1, that is the lack of basic information about the site, I suggested additions on the sidebar. In my view, the user should always be able to see clearly where he/she is at the moment.</li><br>
            <li>To make the impact of the previous point even stronger, I suggested a list of all the subpages (as links) on the sidebar as well. They would give the users the whole picture right away and help them to move further on the site at any time. This change has its risks though. Can the links distract the user from the content in hand? </li><br>
            <li>My last question was the possibility of hiding the escape routes mentioned in the problem 4 for good or at least when scrolling. That would strengthen the feeling of an individual website even if it is a part of the MSF main site.</li>
          </ol>

    <h4>Conclusions</h4>

    <section class="flucht_section">
      <div class="container">
        <div>
          <p>Like I wrote above, it is not yet clear which changes take place and in which time window. That is why my before/after screenshots have to wait. In non-governmental organizations, the resources are often rather limited. However, I believe that every single improvement would help the user to understand the website better. Even with the smallest changes the difference can be made.</p>
          <p>I think that this website is a good example of what can go wrong if the potential user is not seen objectively enough. Many good ideas are good only with certain preliminary information that only the people behind the website have, but not the users. It is really a shame how a beautiful, informative and, most of all, important website can go to waste if the people just cannot find their way. </p>
