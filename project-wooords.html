          <p>Wooords was my first project in UX design. It served as an introductory project in my education at CareerFoundry. The goal was to create a flashcard application for learning vocabulary.</p>
          <p>The basic idea behind the task was to get a feeling of the UX designing process and to learn the basic techniques and, most importantly, the mindset. I carried out competitive analysis, user interviews, and usability tests and, as an end result, created a clickable, hand-drawn prototype.</p>
          <p>Oh, it looks so clumsy now but, please, don’t judge the book by its cover. During this project, I learned the most important thing in UX, namely, the right mindset. I needed to put my own desires and ambitions aside and to really learn to listen to the potential users who often had very different ideas and expectations than me. It was not easy at all to lose the subjectitivity behind the design decisions. Besides that, I learned a lot by committing hundreds of mistakes that I  will never do again. </p>

    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>

    <section class="wooords_section">
      <div class="container">
        <div>
          <p>I started from competitive analysis just to get a hold of the service that I was about to create. It was very helpful to see what others have done, which their ideas were, and which solutions seemed to work and which not.</p>
          <p>I analysed Duolingo, Mondly, and Quizlet which all are very different from each other. It was good to see the various approaches. My analysis was a bit overflowing as I wanted to grasp every little detail. Next time I will have to summarize my findings better. </p>
          <p>After the analysis, my main question was whether the game-like structure support or hinder the learning process. And if so, should I then go for the fun or education?</p>
          <p>The analysis in full can be found <a href="files/wooords_competetive.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <h4>User Interviews</h4>

    <section class="wooords_section">
      <div class="container">
        <div>
          <p>After analysing competititors, it was time to interview some potential customers. I carried out three interviews as I tried to learn about people’s view on language apps and just learning in general. Previous experiences with similar apps were naturally especially precious. </p>
          <p>Surprisingly, the users seemed rather critical towards apps that are too playfull and game-like. They were serious learners and easily put off by light actitivities that didn’t really help them to learn the language. If there were no progress, the apps were fast forgotten.</p>
          <p>These discoveries encouraged me to concentrate on the actual learning process instead of just trying to engage people in a playing experience. </p>
          <p>The interviews in whole can be found <a href="files/wooords_user_interviews.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <h4>Persona</h4>

    <div>
      <section class="wooords_section">
        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <p>Based on the interviews, I created my first persona, Pia, who was a serious learner and who didn’t want to waste her time on anything useless. Now, it was easy to formulate the problem that I was trying to solve. After all, it was Pia who I wanted to help. My app was for her. I listed her biggest challenges in language learning. They were the ones I needed to overcome.</p>

    <h4>Information Architecture</h4>

      <section class="wooords_section">
        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <p>Before getting into sketching, I needed to think about the structure. I drew two user flows to describe some of the most basic processes. The big picture started to find its form in my head. Now, I knew which screens I needed to sketch first.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, these user flows were the biggest challenge for me in this project. It took some time to find the right balance between the amount of information and the visual clarity. </p>

    <h4>Wireframes & Prototypes</h4>

    <div>
      <section class="wooords_section">
        <div class="container list">
          <div>
            <p>For this project, I drew the wireframes by hand and used Prott to build a clickable prototype. The biggest challenge for me was to make the wireframes clear enough. When drawing by hand, it is difficult to use many common tricks that are available in digital design. Besides that, I needed to control my inner artist who wanted to get a bit too creative at times.</p>
            <p>As Pia was my persona to whom I dedicated the whole work, I formulated some <strong>main requirements</strong> that would ensure that the service would satisfy her needs:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Approachable, simple and fast to use.</li>
              <li>Concentration on the quality of basic functions instead of adding too many features.</li>
              <li>Emphasis on high-quality content, namely on the word selection, categories, grammatical information, etc.</li>
              <li>The culture behind the language strongly and entertainingly present in graphics and examples.</li>
              <li>Light reminders and encouraging feedback without giving any false promises or unfounded rewards.</li>
            </ol>

    <h4>Testing</h4>

    <section class="wooords_section">
      <div class="container list">
        <div>
          <p>It was time to test my prototype. I carried out a usability test for four participants. I created a scenario for them to imagine and asked them to perform <strong>four tasks</strong> within this scenario:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Find out the translation for a given word in a given language. Find out the plural form too.</strong><br>
            This main task includes all the basic steps: onboarding, choosing the language, finding the category, reading the instructions, translating the word, and finding additional information.</li>
            <li><strong>Translate another given word and mark it afterwards.</strong><br>
            Here, I wanted to concentrate on the highlighting system which I find important.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a basic user account without paying the premium price.</strong><br>
            Using the menu bar and finding the registration option are among the most crucial functions.</li>
            <li><strong>Add an additional language to learn.</strong><br>
            Here I wanted to test the location of language selection because I was not sure of it.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The full test report can be found <a href="files/wooords_usability_test.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <h4>Improvements</h4>

    <section class="wooords_section">
      <div class="container">
        <div>
          <p>Based on my test findings, I had to do some urgent changes. Afterwards, some of them seem somewhat obvious, but it was good to discover them in an actual testing situation. I learned a lot about people’s behavior in an encounter with a digital device.</p>
          <p>NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE HURRY AND SLOPPINESS!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 wooords_col">
            <div>
              <img src="img/wooords_improvement1.jpg" alt="Wooords Improvement 1" >
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>1. The test subjects didn’t seem to understand that, while onboarding, they should scroll. I decided to highlight the option with the traditional circles while making the ‘skip’ -button less visible.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 wooords_col">
            <div>
              <img src="img/wooords_improvement2.jpg" alt="Wooords Improvement 2" >
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>2. The biggest problem was the location of the ‘add language’ -option. It was better to put it there where people seemed to go, namely in Settings. My Account was in no way needed before the user had created his account.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 wooords_col">

              <img src="img/wooords_improvement3.jpg" alt="Wooords Improvement 3" >
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>3. In order to avoid further confusion, I made it clearer that the Instructions are only instructions and no interaction was expected.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 wooords_col">

              <img src="img/wooords_improvement4.jpg" alt="Wooords Improvement 4" >
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>4. The three numbered tests seemed to confuse people. It was better just to name them sooner rather than later.</p>

    <h4>Conclusions</h4>

    <div>
      <section class="wooords_section">
        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <p>There was still so much to do within this project. I would have loved to add more screens, like Log In, and to carry out more tests. I would have loved to shape the screens in more detail with the right digital tools and to start to formulate the word categories. </p>
            <p>But it was time to move on and just take the crucial learnings with me. Like I wrote in the beginning, I learned many basic skills, techniques and strategies as I turned from no one into an enthustiastic UX beginner. </p>
            <p>But the most important lesson was still the user-centered mindset that I have carried with me ever since. I really had to learn to set aside my ego and subjectivity when making design decisions. After all, that is why we do all the research and create personas.</p>
