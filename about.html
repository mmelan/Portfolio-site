            <p>I'm a social scientist and writer who turned into a UX designer. It's been a long and exciting way driven by the passion for understanding people and their behaviour. Today, instead of books and institutions, technology has the greatest influence on our lives. I just really want to be there where the magic happens. With my passion and my knowledge.
​             With my background, it is maybe obvious that my main interest in UX lies in research and insights. I love to dig deep and find patterns and forms in something that once looked like chaos. Please, go ahead and take a look at my work.</p>

        <h2>What I Can Do</h2>
        <div>

            <div>
              <h3>User Research</h3>
              <p>I just love asking questions. And analysing the answers. I guess I really like people. Observing them and trying to understand them.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>

              <img src="img/ExpertlandChristopher.png" alt="Persona example" >
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Personas</h3>
              <p>I have a lot of experience in creating imaginary people. After all, I used to write fiction.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            <div>
              <img src="img/WooordsUserFlow1.jpg" alt="User flow example" >
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>User Flows & Journeys</h3>
              <p>I am good at visualising thoughts and action patterns. My mentor mentioned that during my education. It sounded so nice that I decided to believe him.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            <div>
              <img src="img/ExpertlandSitemap.jpg" alt="Sitemap example" >
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
              <p>My father was a librarian. I used to work for him when I was young. I helped him to organise old dusty books. It is actually not that far from organising digital information, except for the dust. I don't miss the dust.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            <div>
              <img src="img/ExpertlandWireframeExample.jpg" alt="Wireframe example" >
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Wireframing & Prototyping</h3>
              <p>I can use tools like Sketch and inVision to create wireframes and prototypes. But I am no graphic designer. I am more interested in the content and the structure than the details in appearance. I want things to work.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Usability Analysis & Testing</h3>
              <p>Oh, I love testing, too. To see the products through the users' eyes. To walk with them through the flows.</p>
